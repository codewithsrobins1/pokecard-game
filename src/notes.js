1) Do the standard create-react-app

2) Build with bottom up starting with the single pokecard and working way up
    -Double check import and export Pokedex from "./Pokedex"
 properly for each component

3) Pass in props in app.js to be used in pokecard.js

4) Create Pokecard component that uses the props
    image is from an api and we use variable to help with selecting the id Number for the image

5) create the pokedex component
    create default props
    set the defaults to the given array set
    use map to pass info from Pokecard.js to Pokedex.js

6) Pokecard is taking the values from the defaultProps and using them to make the card
    looping through each object within the defaultProps array

7) Remember styling takes place in each components own css

8) applying styles to index.css affect whole entire application
